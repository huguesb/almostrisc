 MUCH needed instructions
	* register swap (gnl)
	* stack manipulation (gnl)
	* interrupts-related (gnl)
	* multiplication/division (op)
	* streamed
	* add/sub with immediates?


 ROOM for instructions :
 
	* UAL operations :
		* 4 between negb and and
			001100
			001101
			
			001110
			001111
			
		* 12 between not and shl
			010100
			010101
			
			010110
			010111
			
			011000
			011001
			
			011010
			011011
			
			011100
			011101
			
			011110
			011111

	* "variants" (assuming fixed value for 'x' bits) [spec apparently does not allow this...]
		* 63 "variants" of in
		* 63 "variants" of out
		* 7 "variants" of lw (conditionals?)
		* 7 "variants" of sw (conditionals?)
		* 7 "variants" of brl (conditionals?)
		* 7 "variants" of bal (conditionals?)
		
	* brand new
		* 11011 prefix : 2^13 = 8192 (from out to brcc)
		* 111001 prefix : 2^12 = 4096 (from brcc/bacc to brl/bal)
		* 111101 prefix : 2^12 = 4096 (from bal to xx)
		* 11111 prefix : 2^13-1 = 8191 (from xx to reset)
		
		=> 24k instruction slots : more than enough...
